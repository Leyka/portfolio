Hello, my name is Skander, I'm currently finishing my degree as **software engineer**. 
I spend a lot of my free time learning, and improve my programming skill, as long as I'm 
having fun, I'm not counting the time.

I'm very versatile, I learn very fast, but I also like to take time to think about why this or 
this technology has been created, and to solve which problem.
